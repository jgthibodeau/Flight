# Flight TODO

- Perching on objects
	- determine what objects can be perched on
	- animate feet grabbing
	- snap onto objects
	- determine if this will this keep you snapped on the object where you landed, or move you to be on top of it?
	- min speed, min distance, min angle (have to be above?) in order to perch

- Make land movement better
	- prevent slipping on normal terrain
	- don't let slipping rotate the player (lock y rotation?)
	- hop instead of walk? 

- Day/night
	- different creatures at night?
	- moon phases

- Weather
	- clouds
	- rain/snow
	- wind

- Seasons
	- need to stay ahead of winter?
	- change terrain/foliage color, trees drop leaves

- Terrain
	- better generation
	- better water
	- trees/foliage
	- structures?

- Nests
	- build, or find nests
	- allow to skip night

- Enemies
	- research creatures that hunt birds

- Prey
	- research what birds eat
	- use same perching mechanic to get food?

- Stamina
	- max stamina drains over time
	- need to eat to replenish
	- drains faster if colder?
